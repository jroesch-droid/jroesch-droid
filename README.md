## Hi there 👋

I'm Jordan, a senior student at Vassar College pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Statistics with a minor in Computer Science and Data Science.

I will be pursuing my master's in Data Science and Statistics at San Diego State University once I am done at Vassar College.

I currently work on small projects in my free time.
