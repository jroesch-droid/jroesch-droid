## Hi there 👋

I'm Jordan, a senior student at Vassar College pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Statistics with a minor in Computer Science and Data Science.

I will be pursuing my master's in Data Science and Statistics at SDSU once I am done at Vassar.

I currently work on a Bayesian predictor model for sports betting
